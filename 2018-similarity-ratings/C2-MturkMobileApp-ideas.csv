11432,2017+AC0-12+AC0-28 17:35:41.327,notification/warning for hits that require a lot of data download/upload to keep users from overusing any data plan they subscribe to. maybe ability to only accept certain hits if connected to wifi or set a data transfer limit for each worker.,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,243
11194,2017+AC0-12+AC0-14 09:25:42.514,Sort available HITS by ones that allow (or even require) the task to be performed on a mobile device or tablet.  Many HITS don't allow workers to do the task on anything other than a desktop PC.  This would save the worker a lot of time and hassle.,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,248
11386,2017+AC0-12+AC0-22 10:18:06.901,+ACI-Build into the app full vocal capabilities. Allow the user to fill in box that require typing by voice command. Typing out a 500 word document on a phone is a tiresome project, but it would be a lot easier if you could speech to text that document.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,248
11375,2017+AC0-12+AC0-22 10:01:14.169,+ACI-Integrate a chat system available to workers and requesters. This would not only allow a free flow of communication but would humanize the crowd sourced work force, cutting down on senseless rejections and most likely raising the wages that are paid.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,250
11384,2017+AC0-12+AC0-22 10:14:18.854,+ACI-Make the app so HITs are mostly done in frame. This way it does away with the need to cut and paste survey codes. The HITs in frame would be tied to our Mturk IDs and make submitting the HIT easier, as well as less chance to submitted the wrong code.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,250
11361,2017+AC0-12+AC0-22 09:21:16.548,i want an app that will enable me me to know when new hits which i qualify is available. i will also the app to be able to tell which hit  gives how much money and if they have bonus. i should be able to use the app to be able to be in a real time communication.,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,262
11366,2017+AC0-12+AC0-22 09:32:05.145,+ACI-Make a feature where your filter settings are the default each time that you open the app. For example, I might want my sorting to be based on newest hits that pay at least +ACQ-.50. I would like that setting to always be set even if I close the app and open it again.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,264
11171,2017+AC0-12+AC0-14 09:15:28.212,Important:  have a feature in the app that will easily allow one to minimize the QWERTY screen (and then maximize again).  When doing HITS on my cell I have an issue minimizing that screen (when done typing) so I can advance to the next page.  It's very frustrating.,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,266
11246,2017+AC0-12+AC0-14 10:05:38.615,The ability to find the requester that I enjoy doing. It is hard to find the requester that a user worked and loved working with. It will be great to be able to search requester by name and pull the requester up to see if they have new work or the same work available. ,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,269
11385,2017+AC0-12+AC0-22 10:16:09.745,Show the length of time until HITs are either accepted or rejected. It is not fair to the workers that we do not know how long it will be till we are paid for the work that we do. A 30 day window does not allow for people to depend on the money they make on MTurk with any reliability.,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,285
11424,2017+AC0-12+AC0-28 17:33:54.834,+ACI-The website needs to have features not found on the desktop site. It needs to have estimated earnings, projected earnings, and so on and so forth. This will add substantial value to people who enjoy turking on their phone or who dont have time to sit down to answer questions on a desktop.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,289
11182,2017+AC0-12+AC0-14 09:19:33.912,+ACI-Enable scripts that are already designed to work on such devices.  For this idea, I want to specifically mention Panda Crazy.  Apart from accepting HITS and perhaps Turkopticon scripts, this is the most important script.  Experienced turkers rely on Panda's so all is lost without this functionality.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,300
11202,2017+AC0-12+AC0-14 09:29:30.192,+ACI-Allow workers to return completed HITs if the HIT has been submitted, but has not been approved. For example some times  after I submitted the HIT, I feel like I gave out too much info on a survey and I don't want to share that data, I want to have the option to return that return if it hasn't been approved.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,309
11472,2017+AC0-12+AC0-28 17:49:25.475,+ACI-Maybe have some forum interface as well so you can not only look and find hits, but give back to the community as a whole. So mturk forum and Turkerhub as well as reddit r/htwf. All of these things will not only benefit the turker, but allow them to actively ask for help on the forums as well so they can better get up and running.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,332
11208,2017+AC0-12+AC0-14 09:31:42.094,+ACI-Have a database (native to the app) to save the HIT title and requester name for completed HITS.  Right now, workers use a script called HIT Database but it's unclear when it will be functional with the new worker site.  This is one of the must have scripts for workers so it would be critical to have this feature on a dedicated mobile app.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,341
11365,2017+AC0-12+AC0-22 09:30:18.092,+ACI-Make a Type of work feature that divides certain hits based on the type of HIT that they are. For example, some hits are transcription based but others are surveys. Other hits require creativity and some other hits are simply tasks that require a human to solve. Examples of work type could be: Creativity, Survey, Transcription, Human+AC0-required task, etc.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,355
11210,2017+AC0-12+AC0-14 09:34:29.334,+ACI-Tie in the app with a dedicated forum that helps people learn how to use their mobile device or tablet more effectively on the platform.  On that note, ensure that the tutorials for this app are easy to understand.  The platform is confusing enough (especially for new workers who may be younger and more accustomed to working from their mobile device).  This can be done but it's going to take a lot of work.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,409
11228,2017+AC0-12+AC0-14 09:57:37.381,+ACI-I would like to see a way to view all of the hits in your Que that are assigned to you without leaving the hit that I am working on. So basically, viewing the 'hits assigned to you' page should work as a template that can overlay on top of whatever page you are working on doesn't interrupt the hit your working on it only overlays the names of the hits and some shortcuts to get to each on top of the screen like a pop up menu would.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,434
11431,2017+AC0-12+AC0-28 17:35:36.189,+ACI-One hugely favorable feature would be a built in scraper. To turk effectively right now, we need multiple screens with scrapers going on each. The app should have a scraper set in the background that is constantly running that natively pulls turkopticon scores so it makes grabbing a hit easy. The biggest issue with mturk is taking the risk on a poor requester. The scraper needs to do everything the desktop version does, but more. Maybe send small notifications up that a HIT is found that meets certain criteria that is user defined.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,537
11449,2017+AC0-12+AC0-28 17:40:45.708,+ACI-A sightly tougher option would be to maybe implement some web interfaces. Hitnotifier.com would take some of the complexity out of the scraper option as the notifier website is essentially scraped hits already. the ability to do grab those hits directly would be super nice. In addition, have a PANDA option where the user can see a hit that they didnt get previously, but set it aside in the event they can grab it later. These are HUGE features that the desktop version has that if implemented well, would revolutionize mobile turking.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,537
11233,2017+AC0-12+AC0-14 10:00:47.003,I think a features with the scripts that we use on the computer will be awesome. I like MTS which allows a person to be able to catch hits and find hits. I also think that typing for certain surveys are thinks that require a lot of typing should have some type of auto completion feature. This will make it easier when completing task on a mobile device. I think that a feature that allows the user to view the requester ratings so that the user know if the requester is going to pay or if the hit is not worth the pay. Some requester takes advantage of people. ,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,562
11416,2017+AC0-12+AC0-28 17:32:34.167,+ACI-The mobile app should/will need to integrate directly with qualtrics. Right now, it launches external pages/tabs within a browser which makes things very difficult and time consuming. Overtime, the ability to run qualtrics/survey monkey natively will need to be addressed. It would be nice that once i get to the final page in qualtrics, If i had a button that I could press and it would submit the code back into mTurk and submit the HIT rather than me having to manually copy the code over. On the desktop, this is the end of the world, but on mobile, it's a little more cumbersome.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,584
11405,2017+AC0-12+AC0-28 17:30:24.195,+ACI-I think all in all, the new mobile website is fine, however the issue lies when you need to actually complete a hit. You are based in a browser already, that which is the new turk website, so what ends up happening, is you have to get another browser open which in turn, makes things very complicated as then now you are switching from browser tab to browser tab within your preferred browser. This is not only time consuming, but in my opinion, feels insecure in my mind. I dont like knowing that i could accidentally close out of something by accident and then poof, i would lose my work.+ACI-,Brainstorm Features for Mturk Mobile App,590
