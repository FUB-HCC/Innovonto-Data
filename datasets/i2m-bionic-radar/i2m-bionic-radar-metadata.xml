        <dcterms:description>The second idea contest within the Ideas-to-Market Project. The Fraunhofer FHR, which
            provided a new radar technology (called Bionic Radar) that uses machine learning to uniquely detect
            movement patterns via radar, working even in bad weather.

            In the Application Case 2 (ac2) we got 3 different research descriptions.
            We conducted 6 data-collection rounds (3xTest, 3xLive) and collected 581 Sparks and 102 sessions.
            The challenges had static inspirations
            for the test-challenge, the inspirations were a word cloud and a video
            for the live-challenge, the inspirations were word cloud, video and two images

            The first round (i2m-bionic-radar-test-1) contained 4 HITS:
            371Q3BEXDHGGIGFWVT7P43JYFWPSZ6

            337F8MIIMZK0EA7V1YYF0106J9440K
            Those hits ran from 2019-04-01 11:19:06 -0700 to 2019-04-01 15:06:56 -0700

            The second round (i2m-bionic-radar-live) contained 10 HITS:
            metaphorical:

            Those hits ran from 2019-04-30 11:47:41 -0700 to 2019-05-05 13:38:35 -0700


            The CeRRI used those 581 sparks to cluster and then generated 24 Ideas out of them.
            We send the sparks to CeRRI at 03.05.2019 and received ideas at 03.06.2019

            Those were partially inspired by sparks.

            The ideas were then given to the experts, which then generated Y options.
            The options were created at the date of the group workshop: 26.06.2019

        <dcterms:description>
            A technology combines the functionality of two components: radar unit and artificial intelligence.
            The radar unit enables the detection of moving objects, such as humans, living beings or objects. For this
            purpose, the technology emits radar waves, which are reflected by the respective object and returned to the
            radar unit. The reflected signal contains object-specific information about its movement and properties.
            This object information is subsequently analyzed using artificial intelligence (AI). By storing the
            information in a database and comparing it with movement data of other objects, the technology can recognize
            comprehensive movement patterns. Additionally, the AI component ​​recognizes objects that have previously
            been recorded, thus allowing their exact identification.
            The technology described above even functions in conditions of constrained visibility and in complete
            darkness. Severe weather conditions and visual obstacles such as smoke, smog or steam pose no problem. Even
            biological substances such as human clothing or animal fur do not interfere with movement detection.
            However, metal and water remain opaque and cannot be penetrated. The technology is approximately hand-sized
            and can be used anywhere.

            A technology can perceive the movement of objects such as people, living beings and objects. By remembering
            the object’s movement, it is capable of recognizing the same object later on. Furthermore, the technology
            can compare the object’s movement with the movement of other objects, and thereby conclude comprehensive
            movement patterns. These movement patterns enable the detection of objects with the same movement profile.
            The technology described above even functions in conditions of constrained visibility and in complete
            darkness. Severe weather conditions and visual obstacles such as smoke, smog or steam pose no problem. Even
            biological substances such as human clothing or animal fur do not interfere with movement detection.

            A technology can perceive the movement of an object, such as humans, living beings or objects, like a bat.
            Once remembered, the technology can subsequently recognize it like a mother can pick her child out of a
            crowd. By comparing the object’s movement with the movement of other objects, the technology can recognize
            comprehensive movement patterns, like a good doctor can diagnose a knee disease by observing a specific
            walking motion.
